# TickIt

An Android app that lets you search Ticketmaster events by category and city, view event details, save favorites, and locate venues on a map.

---

## Features
- **Event Search**  
  - Search by category (Music, Sports, Theater, etc.) and city.  
  - Results displayed in a `RecyclerView` with custom `CardView` layouts.  
  - Persistent ‚Äúlast search‚Äù using SharedPreferences.

- **MVVM Architecture**  
  - `EventsViewModel` handles network calls (Retrofit + Gson) and exposes LiveData.  
  - Fragments observe the same ViewModel to share state (search results, selected venue).

- **Favorites**  
  - Tap ‚ÄúFavorite‚Äù to save an event locally (Room database).  
  - Favorites tab shows all saved events.  
  - Toggle off to remove; database changes propagate via LiveData.

- **Map Integration**  
  - ‚ÄúFind Venue‚Äù button opens a Google Map fragment.  
  - Marker placed & info window shown immediately.  
  - Coordinates passed via Navigation arguments or shared ViewModel.
